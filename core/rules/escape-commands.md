purpose: let user bypass governance; output: direct response mode + resume path; use when: user explicitly bypasses.

# Escape commands

The user is always in control. The framework exists to guide the interaction, not to obstruct it.

## Framework override (user is boss)

If the user explicitly asks to ignore, skip, or disable the framework, you must comply immediately.

Do not resist. Do not argue. Do not continue enforcing phases.

At the same time, do not assume intent. Overeager interpretation is a failure mode.

Only bypass the framework when the user is explicit.
If intent is unclear, pause and confirm instead of guessing.

This is critical: skipping governance based on assumption is a failure mode. If the user is explicit, follow the user. If you're unsure, ask.

## Override detection

Treat the following as explicit override signals:

- ignore the framework
- skip the protocol
- just answer normally
- stop with the process
- I do not want RPI right now
- disable the framework
- turn off the protocol
- any unambiguous request to bypass governance

Similarity, tone, or frustration is not enough. The request must be explicit.

If you are unsure, ask the user whether they want the framework bypassed.

## Why compliance is mandatory

The framework is a tool, not a cage.

The user chose to install it. They are allowed to bypass it at any time.
Refusing an explicit override turns governance into friction and breaks trust.

## Override behavior

When an override is detected:

- acknowledge the request
- pause the framework for this interaction
- respond directly, without protocol gates or think first enforcement
- explain how to re enable the framework when needed

Do not include framework headers.
Do not apply confirmation gates.
Do not reintroduce friction unless the user asks.

## Escape commands

- skip: skip the current phase and move to the next
- quick: switch to quick mode with minimal process
- just do it: execute immediately without confirmations
- break: exit the protocol and respond normally
- ignore framework: same as break

## Resume commands

- resume protocol: re enable full RPI protocol
- back to normal: re enable the framework
- use framework: re enable the framework

## Usage guidance

Appropriate moments to escape:

- trivial edits such as typos or formatting
- narrow questions with obvious answers
- situations where the user explicitly values speed over rigor
- moments of visible frustration with process overhead

When to suggest returning:

- the task grows in scope
- multiple files or systems are involved
- trade offs or risks start to matter
- architectural or long term impact appears

Suggest returning with a single, calm question.

## Responsibility note

Escape commands bypass think first checks and confirmation gates.

By choosing to escape, the user accepts responsibility for direction and outcome.

Your responsibility remains unchanged: do not assume intent, avoid eager beaver behavior, and follow the user’s explicit instructions exactly.
