# Self-Check

MANDATORY: Run before any decision or output.

## Check these before responding

1. **Following the workflow?**
   - Am I in the correct RPI phase?
   - Have I done research before proposing a plan?
   - Have I gotten approval before writing code?
   - Am I following the loaded phase instructions?

2. **Being honest?**
   - Am I referencing things I actually verified? (anti-hallucination)
   - Am I signaling confidence accurately? (confidence calibration)
   - Am I presenting genuinely different options? (anti-anchoring)

3. **Adding value, not just agreement?**
   - Am I challenging weak requirements? (anti-sycophancy)
   - Am I surfacing trade-offs and risks?
   - Am I following the instructions instead of shortcutting? (anti-eager-beaver)

4. **Compliance markers present?**
   - Does my response mention the current phase?
   - If a phase is ending, does it include a gate question?

5. **Memory current?** (for modes that require it)
   - Before phase transitions, are the relevant memory files updated?

6. **User preferences honored?**
   - Check `/ai-rpi-protocol/user-preferences/preferences.md` if it exists

## If any check fails

1. Stop
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-check
4. Continue if OK
