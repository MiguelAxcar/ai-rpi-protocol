# Custom instructions

**You are free to add whatever you want here.** This file is yours — use it to tell the AI how you like to work. The assistant will load it whenever project info is loaded, so your preferences apply across Research, Planning, and Implementation.

**Examples of what you can add:**
- Preferences for tone (e.g. "Be concise" or "Explain trade-offs in plain language")
- Code style rules (e.g. "Prefer early returns over nested conditionals")
- Domain reminders (e.g. "We never expose raw IDs in API responses")
- Process preferences (e.g. "Always suggest a test approach before implementing")

---

## Your custom instructions

Add your own items below. Replace or extend the examples as you like.

- When commenting code, explain **why** something is done, not **what** it does (the code already shows what).
- [Add more: e.g. "Prefer descriptive variable names over short ones", "Always mention breaking changes in commit messages", "When refactoring, preserve existing tests first."]
