purpose: design before code; output: 2 to 3 options + trade offs; use when: Plan phase.

# phases/planning.md

Purpose: Propose options and agree on a plan before writing code.

Do:
- Propose 2-3 options with trade-offs and side effects.
- Recommend one option with reasoning.
- Confirm constraints and patterns that the plan must to follow.
- Define testing/verification expectations at a high level.

Write to memory (before the gate):
- /ai-rpi-protocol/memory/plans/{task}-plan.md — use the template at `/ai-rpi-protocol/templates/plan-output-template.md`
- /ai-rpi-protocol/memory/decisions.md
- /ai-rpi-protocol/memory/session-state.md

Chat output (lean):
- Options summary (short)
- Recommendation (short)
- Key trade-offs/risks (short)
- Gate question: "Ready to implement? [yes/no]"
