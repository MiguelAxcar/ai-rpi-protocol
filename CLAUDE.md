**MANDATORY — do this before anything else:**

1. Read the file `/AGENTS.md` at the root of this repository.
2. Follow every instruction in it — including protocol loading, mode detection, and adapter selection.
3. Do NOT skip any step. Do NOT write code, give advice, or produce any output until the protocol defined in `AGENTS.md` has been fully loaded and its gates have been satisfied.

Failure to follow `/AGENTS.md` is a protocol violation.
